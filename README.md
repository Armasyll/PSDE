# Pack Street: The Game
### Really just a testbed for another javascript game thing I've been writing.

No money is made from this game, yo.

Zootopia belongs to Disney, Pack Street (name, setting, specific characters) belongs to TG_Weaver, and I'm sure I'm missing a few other notes.

## About the game

It's a browser-based 3d game.
